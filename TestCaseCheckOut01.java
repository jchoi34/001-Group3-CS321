/*
POSSIBLE CASES THAT WOULD CAUSE TROUBLE AT CHECKOUT:
- ZERO PEOPLE CHECKOUT
- PEOPLE CHECKOUT BUT ROOMS ARE NOT CLEARED
- CHECKOUT A REAL PERSON WITH A MISSPELLED NAME
- CHECKOUT AN IMAGINARY PERSON (IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO BE SURE THE GUEST IN QUESTION IS ACTUALLY STAYING AT THAT HOTEL)
** THE IDEA TO ENSURE THAT PRE AND POST CONDITIONS ARE TRUE AND THE CORRECT ROOM AVAILABILITY IS MAINTAINED
* If the method throws exceptions, check to see what triggers the exceptions correctly. Also test edge cases, what happens if it receives a 'null'.
* Does it correctly change the the state of the object that it operates on?
